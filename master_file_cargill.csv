What happens when 27 farmers from 19 countries get together in one place? ‘Collectively, we can raise our voice’","

Mary Boote Roth knows that if you put a few farmers in a room, “it won’t be very long before they start a conversation.”

The CEO of the Global Farmer Network (GFN) had more than a few in the room in January, bringing 27 farmers from 19 different countries together in Mexico City for the inaugural Roundtable & Farmer Leadership Training course. GFN is a nonprofit that brings farmers together to find solutions to critical issues, such as sustainability, trade and technology. The program’s goals were to find common ground on shared challenges, to learn how to engage with stakeholders, including the media, and to ensure their voice is part of how agriculture can provide solutions to global and local dilemmas. Cargill provided funding to enable the program to take place, which was hosted at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT).

While the farmers who assembled may look from the outside like very different people, “they find what they have in common very quickly,” Boote said, from similar challenges like extreme weather to shared values of dignity and empowerment for everyone.

“We're here to share stories, to encourage and learn from each other,” she said “We want farmers to become international ambassadors for agriculture.”

Here are a few of the things they covered:

Their world is complicated, and changing quickly

Ask farmers what their biggest challenges are and the answers come fast: thin margins, climate change, trade, public policies, consumer preferences. From crises driven by weather to systemic issues like young people moving out of rural areas, it’s not an easy time to be a farmer.

“The game has changed quite a bit” said Javier Callejas, a poultry farmer in Nicaragua. “So you have to adapt very quickly. And you have to be very creative to make it to the other side.”

Javier said coming together with other farmers reminded him that he’s not facing these issues alone.

“You see common themes that happen all across the farming community,” he said. “Understanding how some of them have dealt with those issues helped me understand what I could do on my side to tackle some of these things as we go forward.”

They care about the planet

Farmers are “the original environmentalists,” said Megz Reynolds, who farms lentils, wheat, barley, flax and sunflowers in Canada. Their work and livelihoods depend on a healthy planet.

“We need a healthy environment, we need healthy soil, we need healthy weather systems in order to be able to do what we do,” she said. “So we're not out there trying to negatively affect the environment, negatively affect anything, or create more emissions. We're working with the best tools that we can for our operations so that we can create a better future for our environment.”

Gina Guttierez, a dairy farmer in Mexico, agreed.

“Sustainability is very important for farming today. We like think of ourselves as stewards of the earth,” she said.  “So we take care of the land. We take care of water and use it responsibly, because it's not only what our cows drink or what us humans drink, but also the water that we're putting into our crops.”

They want to be part of the conversation

“I think a very important step is for us to share our stories, to share what we’re doing on the farm, why we’re doing what we’re doing,” Reynolds said.

She came to farming after a career in the film industry, and realized she had her own misconceptions about things like pesticides and GMOs.

“I realized I needed to get involved in that conversation in a way that I would never (?) have understood before I came to the farm,” she said.

That’s even more important when the conversations revolve around policies and decisions that affect farmers.

“It's important to get farmer voices in this in the settings where decisions are being made,” said Onyaole Patience Koku, a farmer from Nigeria. “A lot of the time you find that people are making decisions for farmers without actually understanding the issues. Wherever it is in the world, you need to understand what the person’s challenges are in order to meet them.”

Gaytri Devi, a farmer who grows rice, wheat, barley and other crops in India, said coming together amplifies farmers’ voices — and help them connect with people who might understand the work they do.

“Collectively, we can raise our voice,” she said. “People can see what’s on their plate. We can tell them where it comes from.”

Where does Cargill rank on animal welfare? Among the best, according to this global benchmark","

When Lacey Alexander went to college, she thought she wanted to become a veterinarian. Then she saw a job posting at one of Cargill’s protein facilities. In the end, she chose to take care of animals – although she didn’t ultimately become a vet.

Alexander is an animal welfare advisor for Cargill Protein- North America, and has played a key role in Cargill achieving a Tier 2 ranking from the Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare (BBFAW), the leading global measure of company performance on farm animal handling and wellbeing.

Each year, BBFAW evaluates more than 150 companies and ranks them in six tiers, with tiers 1 and 2 made up of companies that have best incorporated animal welfare into their strategy. Only 22 organizations reached the top tiers this year—Cargill for the fourth consecutive time.

Alexander’s work directly impacts our BBFAW ranking. She visits Cargill’s beef plants across the U.S., observing and recommending improvements. She also spends time with producers, industry associations and academics to share best practices.

“Animals are sentient creatures,” she said. “They are making the ultimate sacrifice: giving their lives to nourish ours. It’s our responsibility to give them the best care we can.”

She says Cargill’s BBFAW ranking is a reflection of our plants and producer partners. “We’re in Tier 2 because we have the best employees and outstanding producers.”

Cementing our leadership

As a leader in delivering protein to the world’s tables every day, Cargill is committed to treating animals with respect and dignity. We also know it’s important to our customers.

This is something Kristin Tupa, sustainability manager for Cargill Protein – North America, has seen firsthand. After joining Cargill as a wheat trader, she moved on to the egg business, where she helped a major quickservice restaurant chain transition to cage-free eggs, among other projects.

“Our customers want to know we’re a leader in animal welfare. BBFAW is a third-party recognition of leadership that gives us that credibility,” Tupa said.

She says BBFAW is particularly meaningful because it looks at our progress across species, providing a holistic assessment of our policies, programs and metrics—as well as areas for improvement.

During the past year, Cargill has made several investments focused on animal welfare. For instance, an AI-driven project in China is listening to chicken vocalizations to identify patterns that may signal a health or welfare problem before it’s detectable by the human eye.

In Ireland, Cargill is investing in Cainthus, a startup that uses computer vision software to monitor nutrition, health and well-being among cattle, with the potential to expand to other species.

Through our ongoing partnership with Temple Grandin’s research team at Colorado State University, we continue to work on minimizing discomfort for cattle during the harvesting process.

Like Alexander, Tupa is quick to acknowledge that our progress has been a team effort.

“We work with phenomenal producers who share our values and commitment to animal welfare,” she said. “To get to Tier 2, every part of the chain has to be strong.”

How one team in West Africa is protecting forests in our cocoa supply chain, step by step","

On the cocoa plantations of Côte d'Ivoire, smartphones in hand, Gertrude Loua and her team are making maps.

They’re recording the precise boundaries of the farms that supply us with cocoa. They’re training farmers on best practices in management, data collection and certification. And they’re playing a key role in identifying parts of our supply chain that might be at risk for deforestation.

“It helps us understand where the risks are,” said Luoa, monitoring and evaluation coordinator for Cargill West Africa, “What’s close to forests or protected areas? Where do we need to take a closer look?”

It’s an important step in helping us understand where our cocoa comes from to uphold our commitments not to source from critical protected areas and transform our supply chains to be deforestation-free.

Cargill Global Sustainability Leader Jill Kolling discussed the process in-depth in a recent article on GreenBiz.com. Read the piece here.

Game on! Cargill-funded programs get kids active, eating well ","

Recess used to spell trouble for teachers at Team Academy in Waseca, Minnesota. Students weren’t interested in participating in activities, which led to boredom, behavior issues and fighting.

With some creative thinking and a Cargill-funded “Game On” grant from Action for Healthy Kids, the school turned things around at recess.

For starters, it split recess into two shorter, separate breaks during the day. It also added a ball pit and painted boundary lines to facilitate more structured games and activities. With monthly staff and student challenges, now nearly all students choose to be active during recess.

These are the kinds of outcomes Action for Healthy Kids wants at all the schools it supports. The Chicago-based nonprofit organization strives to foster healthy eating habits, increase physical activity, and improve overall health and well-being for kids across the U.S. by helping schools implement programming that supports the health of the whole child.

“Kids spend more than 1,200 hours each year in school, so that environment is key to creating healthy habits,” said Grace Perry, program manager with Action for Healthy Kids. “And we know that healthy, active students are better prepared to learn.”

Expanding support

Cargill supports Action for Healthy Kids at 122 schools across the U.S. by funding its Game On School Engagement Program. The program offers tailored solutions to help schools create healthier learning environments for students.

Since 2016, we have provided more than $850,000 in grants. Our funding has supported school gardens, functional fitness training, active indoor recess programs, before- and after-school wellness clubs and healthy cooking classes, among other projects.

“Thanks to Cargill’s support, students are building lifelong healthy habits and have greater access to innovative nutrition and physical activity opportunities,” said Perry. “With strong community partners, our schools are better able to help students succeed.”

Cargill’s support has been targeted at communities in Iowa, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Wisconsin, where we have several business locations. With our most recent grant, we expanded our support to communities where our protein business has operations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Kansas, Tennessee and Nebraska.

“Cargill is committed to providing people with nutritious food and advancing our purpose of nourishing the world in a safe, responsible and sustainable way,” said Pete Stoddart, community and employee engagement lead at Cargill. “Encouraging good habits for our kids now will have a lasting effect on our communities.”

Partnerships with organizations like Action for Healthy Kids are part of Cargill’s commitment to community engagement. We focus our support in three areas: nourishing our world, protecting our planet and enriching our communities. In fiscal 2019, Cargill charitable giving reached $61.2 million across 56 countries.

Protein innovation: Cargill invests in cultured protein","

With a world where the population expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050, the demand for protein is rising. Cargill is investing and innovating broadly across our global supply chain – in animal and alternative protein.

To date, our investments in cultured protein include 2017 and 2020 investments in Memphis Meats, a U.S.-based leader in cultured protein products. In 2019 we also invested in Aleph Farms, an Israel-based cell-cultured protein company focused on growing complex meat varieties like steak.

This complements investments in plant-based protein like PURIS, North America’s largest producer of pea protein. We also make specialty sweeteners and texturizers for plant-based dairy alternatives.  

“Our strategy is to invest in all forms of protein,” said Brian Sikes who leads Cargill’s global protein businesses. “Our cell-cultured protein and plant-based investments will continue to complement the $1.5 billion we have invested in animal protein over the last three years. Keeping all options on the table will help feed people and deliver great-tasting protein for our customers.”

Cargill aims to BeefUp Sustainability","

As global demand for protein increases, farmers, ranchers and agribusiness are continuing efforts to feed a growing population, address climate change and protect the planet.

To help address this need, Cargill launched BeefUp Sustainability, an initiative committed to achieving a 30% greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity reduction across its North American beef supply chain by 2030. The opt-in initiative will reduce GHG emissions throughout Cargill’s beef supply chain from a 2017 baseline, measured on a per pound of product basis. The 30% reduction builds on the industry’s existing GHG efficiency efforts and will equate to removing 2 million cars from U.S. highways for a year. 

“This initiative builds on the strong environmental stewardship work already led by farmers and ranchers,” said Jon Nash, who leads Cargill’s North American protein business. “Cargill is creating connections across the entire North American beef supply chain. Together, we can expand current sustainable agricultural practices to make a meaningful difference.”

Today, U.S. farmers and ranchers produce 18% of the world’s beef with only 8% of the world’s cattle. In fact, according the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the North American beef supply chain is already more than 35% more efficient from a GHG perspective than the global average. BeefUp Sustainability will build on this momentum and leadership.

Over the next 10 years, Cargill will work with a range of stakeholders to help achieve its goal.

“Significantly reducing GHG requires change across the entire supply chain,” said Heather Tansey, sustainability lead for Cargill’s global animal nutrition and protein businesses. “We know the time to act is now and that agriculture is how we’ll feed people and help protect the planet. We’re investing in science-based practices and have identified focus areas that will ensure we have the greatest environmental impact.”

Focusing on impact



Through this initiative, Cargill will invest in science-based practices, building tailored programs in four key areas:


Grazing management – We’re exploring different practices with ranchers, such as grazing management planning and adaptive management, to understand how they impact sustainability outcomes related to carbon storage, wildlife habitats, water and other ecological and economic parameters.

Feed production – We’re working with farmers to help implement soil health practices in row crops, such as fertilizer optimization and cover crops that lower greenhouse gas emissions from cattle feed ingredients.

Innovation – We’re investing in emerging technologies and introducing new ideas to reduce emissions.

Food waste reduction – We’re identifying ways to partner with customers to reduce food waste and advancing efforts, such as packaging innovation and shelf-life extension.


“We’re working every day with farmers, ranchers and supply chain partners to continue to serve as stewards of the earth while achieving greater business results and efficiencies,” said Nash.

Informing the journey towards zero deforestation ","

Cargill’s efforts to end deforestation within our direct cocoa supply chain have been progressing apace. In 2018, we introduced our Protect Our Planet Strategic Action Plan, a five-prong pathway for reducing our environmental impact, including ending deforestation and promoting restoration. We have since gathered valuable insights about the risks of deforestation in areas where we source cocoa and are using these to deliver on our commitment towards the Cocoa & Forests Initiative (CFI), with the aim to progressively scale our learnings across our entire direct supply chain by 2030.











Cocoa trees flourish under very specific conditions. A healthy ecosystem that balances cocoa cultivation and forest conservation is crucial for long-term, sustainable cocoa production. However, when the benefits of forests are not understood, or where Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) are not applied, cocoa farming can jeopardize these conditions. Given these and other factors that can contribute to deforestation, it is vital that we don’t just identify at-risk areas, but also understand the underlying causes in order to deploy the right interventions in the right place.

Technology plays a key role here. To help identify at-risk areas, we first collect data about the farms from which we source cocoa. Using GPS mapping and farm surveys, we collect digital information on farm perimeters, shade tree coverage, productivity and crop health. We’re committed to mapping all the farms in our direct supply chain, and so far, we have mapped more than 100,000 farmers in Côte d’Ivoire and 19,200 farmers in Ghana.

To define on how to best work with farmers and farmer organizations to address underlying causes, we work closely with partners to understand the local context and then to design targeted and relevant solutions that address the challenges in question.

In Côte d’Ivoire, for instance, field assessments conducted by PUR Projet have been crucial to identifying the wider socio-economic causes of deforestation and forest degradation. Our experience shows us that community-based agroforestry – the integration of trees onto farms or into the wider landscape – can help tackle some of these underlying causes. Besides improving soil fertility and habitats, different tree species grown on cocoa farms can provide alternative sources of income such as fruits, nuts or fibers, and on the longer-term sustainably harvested timber. Planting trees also helps to stabilize cocoa yields by creating a favorable microclimate and supporting pollination. This triggers a virtuous cycle that increases incomes for individual farmers and improves communities’ economic resilience. 

Our agroforestry programs typically involve a preliminary phase where we work with farmers to select appropriate tree species and identify a suitable planting design, after which we order seedlings and organize trainings on tree planting and maintenance. We then distribute seedlings to farmer communities, who plant and nurture them with help of locally employed agroforestry technicians within the farmer cooperatives.

Between 2018 and 2019, our community-based interventions in Cote d’Ivoire led to the planting of over 320,000 shade trees, thanks to the engagement of 3,000 farmers across 12 cooperatives.

Cocoa communities have been keen to learn more about how they can restore their lands and make their cocoa production more sustainability through agroforestry. Diomande Moussa, a cooperative technician specialized in the follow-up of agroforestry activities, said, “My motivation for this project stems from the story of a tree I planted in 5th grade. Today I feel proud when I see this tree; it somehow reminds me that planting a tree is bringing a new life on earth. Planting a tree is saying yes to life and no to climate change.”

Throughout this process, our partners at PUR Projet help us remain grounded. Andrew Nobrega, PUR Projet’s Director for North America, notes, “Engaging cooperatives and farmers from the beginning has been essential. Lack of communications and alignment between all stakeholders can be a major barrier, especially in projects with this scale.” He adds, “By onboarding communities earlier on to co-design solutions that truly work for them, we’re seeing tangible results and creating an enabling environment for sustainable farming practices and ecosystem protection to thrive.” 

As well as providing technical assistance to farmers, we aim to achieve wider impact by connecting all stakeholders in the cocoa value chain. Together we are setting out to promote incentive schemes to cover additional labor requirements, support land tenure and advantageous property rights, establish market linkages, and conduct long-term monitoring and assessment. Ultimately, we want to develop viable economic income models for farmers that fully capture benefits of agroforestry.

This is how we will deliver on the Cargill Cocoa Promise going forward: by protecting our planet’s natural resources while also ensuring the cocoa farmers we work with, and the communities we work in, can thrive.

How a sustainable coconut oil project improved livelihoods for smallholder farmers in the Philippines and Indonesia","

The global demand for coconut-based products is growing. Coconut oil, for instance, is used for cooking and in products like chocolate or cakes, as well as cosmetics. However, the coconut supply is not growing as fast as the demand.

In Indonesia and the Philippines – world leaders in coconut production and exportation – most farmers are smallholders that struggle with lack of financing and training. Poor agricultural practices led to aging plantations and declining yields and incomes.

Beginning in 2011, Cargill identified an opportunity to use its unique position to deliver solutions that would help coconut farmers in those countries increase their productivity and profitability through sustainable, innovative agricultural practices, inclusive market access and resilient agricultural communities.

For Cargill, this meant securing sources of certified coconut oil to meet the growing demand on the international market, while leaving a positive impact on the environment and enabling farmers, partners and other critical stakeholders to achieve greater business results and efficiencies.

The project was developed as part of the develoPPP.de program of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). Along with BASF, Procter & Gamble (P&G), the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and other national partners, Cargill trained smallholders in farm management skills to improve their business. Farmers also received training in good agricultural practices, such as intercropping and integrated pest management, to create more resilient farms.

More than 4,000 farmers – over half of them women – received training, and 1,600 of them received additional training and were certified in line with the Rainforest Alliance Sustainable Agriculture Standard.

On average, farmers who were trained and certified report 47 percent higher agricultural income compared to those who didn’t participate in the program. Productivity for certified farmers rose 26 percent compared to non-involved farmers.

Through the project, Cargill and its partners were able to establish the Sustainable Certified Coconut Oil (SCNO) supply chain, a socially responsible, environmentally sound and economically viable supply chain that works for everyone. The SCNO aimed to set up a sustainable and transparent supply chain that matched the partners’ commitments towards people and nature, while also managing related risks.

“We are able to significantly improve the economic opportunities and living standards for farmers and their families through this partnership. In turn, we are lifting up their communities, which are primarily in rural and developing areas,” said Jonathan Sumpaico, managing director for Cargill’s grain and oilseed supply chain business in the Philippines. “Cargill will continue to scale our support based on the great work already achieved with smallholder coconut farmers to increase their agricultural productivity and incomes while advancing the supply of sustainable coconut oil in the world.”

Better productivity, better incomes

The success of SCNO depended on the combined expertise of each partner.

Cargill, which owns and operates copra – the dried meat of the coconut – collecting stations and crushing plants, provided training to smallholder farmers and set up the structures for certification. BASF and P&G Crude processed the refined oils to produce ingredients for home and personal care, as well as the nutrition and health industries.

The companies shared their understanding of the market trends, while GIZ, a German government agency, contributed in capacity building and promotion. GIZ is also managing the project and its implementation in close collaboration with Philippines Coconut Authority, the Agricultural Training Institute and other partners, including the Rainforest Alliance, local universities and NGOs, to ensure local ownership.

Since 2018, the first Rainforest Alliance Certified™ coconut oil has been in production in the Philippines with the support of this partnership.

Making a difference for Cargill chocolate customers

Cargill’s cocoa and chocolate business became the first provider in the world to offer coating and fillings that use coconut oil sourced from Rainforest Alliance Certified™ farms.

In its 2017-2018 sustainability report, the business highlights its commitment to provide sustainable chocolate ingredients.

The sustainable coconut oil is used in coatings and fillings for ice cream, confectionery and bakery applications. This is part of Cargill’s larger commitment to help thousands of smallholder coconut farmers improve their livelihoods, while helping to secure and strengthen a sustainable coconut supply chain.

Ag is how young leaders will build a sustainable future. Cargill is helping them get there.","











Years ago, one of the future leaders of agriculture was working on her family farm in northern California, helping her parents and brothers figure out how to grow almonds.

It taught her optimism and resilience, and the power of working together toward a common goal. And it showed Ruth Kimmelshue that she could do anything.

“To put it simply, agriculture is how I became the person I am today,” Cargill’s chief sustainability officer said. “The future of agriculture is deeply personal to me.”

Her remarks came in October 2019 at the annual convention of the National FFA Organization, a group dedicated to leadership and development for young people through agriculture education and opportunities.

Watch her full remarks here.

Cargill, a longtime FFA supporter, is investing $2.1 million over the next three years in the organization to help develop future leaders who are ready to find solutions for feeding a growing population within planetary boundaries.

The convention also presented an opportunity for Cargill to build a bridge between the present and future of agriculture leadership. Kimmelshue described the sweeping advances she’s seen over the course of her career and things her younger self would never have imagined, like plant- and cell-based protein.

She encouraged young leaders to make sustainability part of their work and to be advocates for agriculture as a force for good.

“You’re likely trying to decide what your future looks like,” she said. “If you want to have a positive impact on the planet, if you want to contribute to the newest technologies, if you want to help lift people out of poverty while creating a future for your own family, choose agriculture. Because agriculture is how we’ll do all these things.”

After her remarks, Kimmelshue had a chance to chat with Kayla Kaalberg, a senior at Iowa State University studying global resource systems, agriculture and society, and Spanish.

Kaalberg said sustainability and global citizenship are important to her as she prepares to enter the agriculture industry after she graduates this winter, and that she wants to impact agriculture by being a responsible steward and providing opportunity for farmer prosperity.

Kimmelshue said Kaalberg and other future leaders have an enviable opportunity to drive exciting changes across the industry.

“I look at where you are and I think, ‘oh my gosh, I want to go back and start my career all over again,’” she said. “I think food and agriculture right now is such an exciting place to be. We have really challenging opportunities and challenging issues. But I also believe that collectively we'll figure it out.”

The convention also featured John Niemann, a managing director in Cargill’s protein ingredients business. He said Cargill supports FFA because it knows the future of agriculture will be shaped by its members.

“Their success is our success,” Niemann said. “Working together we can ensure American agriculture continues to build vibrant communities, supports prosperous families and rewarding careers, and produces the food we need to feed a growing population.”

In another session, SriRaj Kantamneni, managing director for digital insights for Cargill’s animal nutrition and health business, described how agriculture has catching up to do to modernize and meet those challenges sustainably. According to McKinsey & Company, it’s one of the least digitalized sectors in the world.

Watch his full remarks here.

He highlighted some of Cargill’s work to close that gap, like using artificial intelligence to improve animal health and welfare on dairy farms or to optimize aquaculture feed.

And he said tech-savvy, forward-thinking young people have an even bigger chance to make a difference and shape the future of the industry.

“I know you’re smart, and I know you can make a difference in our world through agriculture,” he said. “And agriculture is how we’ll make the world a better place.”

Perspectives: Agriculture is How","

Those of us who work in food and agriculture get to see the positive impact our industry makes every day. It’s a simple fact that agriculture – and the farmers, ranchers and growers who are at the heart of it – feeds the world.

We also know our industry isn’t perfect, and sometimes, it is misunderstood. We have critical work ahead of us to make food and ag increasingly safe and sustainable. And, we need to come together to address challenges within the complex supply chains that move food from farms to our forks.

But with challenges, come opportunities. And at Cargill, that’s how we look at agriculture – as an opportunity. Because we know agriculture is how we’ll ensure a safe, responsible and sustainable food system; a food system that cultivates a better future for all of us.

So what does this look like in a practical sense?

It starts with farmers.

Farmers are the original stewards of our land and water. And today, we have new information and technologies that can make their operations more efficient and sustainable.

Take for example soil health. There is great opportunity for soil to hold more carbon and release less into the atmosphere. That’s why we’re partnering with farmers to adopt conservation techniques like reduced tillage, cover crops and nutrient optimization.

These practices also offer long-term benefits for farmers. Put simply, healthier soils grow healthier, more abundant crops. This means higher yields using fewer inputs, and a better overall return on their time and financial investment.

It’s important to acknowledge that new practices can take a few years to perfect. As an industry, we need to help farmers through the early phases of adoption, when their yields may be temporarily reduced or their costs increased.

Technology, tools and training are key enablers.

Technology is contributing to unprecedented changes in agriculture, food and nutrition – including increased traceability and improved application of sustainability practices.

Now, imagine if everyone had access to the tools, technology and training that could help them make better decisions for their business and the planet. Unfortunately, for farmers in some parts of the world, this access has lagged. That’s why partnerships, like the one Cargill has with International Finance Corporation are so critical.

Through our Coop Academy 2.0 program we are empowering cocoa producing cooperatives to improve sustainability while also increasing profitability. The program includes access to a digital payments platform, and a tool that measures and benchmarks the coops’ operations, sustainability, financial and internal management.

This type of technology can lead to better outcomes for farmers and the planet. And, it helps companies like Cargill strengthen the transparency of our own supply chains – something our customers and consumers expect from us.

Collaboration is critical.

Agriculture is how we’ll come together to address global issues – including climate change, deforestation, water conservation, and more. But our company, and our industry, can’t do it alone. It will require continued partnership and collaboration.

Cargill’s commitment to end deforestation is being questioned. We’re listening, but more importantly, we’re taking action.

To accelerate progress across our priority supply chains, we’ve formed a Land Use and Forest Protection Advisory Panel. Members are bringing cross-sector insights to Cargill, building on existing work with other trusted advisors and thought leaders.

We are also advancing our $30-million pledge, which focuses on sourcing and supporting innovative ideas to protect forests and native vegetation in South America. We will soon announce a startup accelerator to find solutions to the deforestation challenges in Brazil. And, we continue to seek partners from across the industry to join us in this effort.

Together, we can create a socially responsible, environmentally sound and economically viable food system that works for everyone.

Agriculture is how we’ll get it done.
